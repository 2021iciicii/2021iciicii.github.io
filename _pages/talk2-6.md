    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    In many optimization problems, the number of decision variables is often unknown in advance. Examples include the number of sensors in a sensor coverage problem, the number of turbines in a wind farm problem, and the number of plies in a laminate stacking problem. In this talk, I will introduce some pioneering research work on single objective and multi-objective variable-length optimization via evolutionary computation.
