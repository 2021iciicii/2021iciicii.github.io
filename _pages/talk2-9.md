    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    The next-generation power grid, named the Smart Grid (SG), has drawn the attention of academia, industry, and government due to the great impact of such systems on society, economics and the environment. These next generation systems integrate control, communication and computation aiming to achieve stability, efficiency, and robustness of the physical processes. While a great amount of research has been done towards these objectives, science and technology related to the cyber-physical security (CPS) of SGs are still immature. Additionally, many critical infrastructures are currently transitioning towards the paradigm of SGs by increasing the dependency of control of physical processes on communication networks, thus becoming exposed to cyber-threats. The SG integrates system functions for control, computation, and communication within the electrical power infrastructure. SGs employ information and communication technologies (ICT) managed by cyber systems to expand the capabilities of the classical power grid, including its capacity to integrate renewable power sources. Extensive deployment of and reliance on ICT inevitably exposes the SG to cyber security threats, which increases the risk of compromised reliability and security of the electrical power infrastructure. This talk will address the current challenges in CPS of SGs Real-Time Monitoring Systems. Different types of Cyber-Physical (CP) Attacks on the State Estimation process will be introduced. Different models and algorithms towards enhancing the State Estimation will be evaluated. Physics-based inspired Artificial Intelligence solutions will be described.

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
    Prof. Arturo Suman Bretas received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA, in 2001. I am currently a Full Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, and the Director of the Power Systems Laboratory. My primary areas of research interest are power systems operation, protection, and control. Considering such areas of specialization, I have held training positions at universities all over the world, including the Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA), Grenoble France, August 2003 to July 2004, where I was a Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) research scholar. Since 2002, I have been involved as a principal investigator in many research and development projects in power systems. These project concerns involve for example, cyber-physical security, power systems frequency and voltage control, state estimation, reliability, and transient stability.
