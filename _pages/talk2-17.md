    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    Privacy preservation is a key concern in data-driven machine learning and decision-making. This talk begins with an introduction to privacy-preserving machine learning and data-driven evolutionary optimization. Then, we present one single-objective and one multi-objective data-driven evolutionary algorithms that can perform optimization based on data distributed on multiple devices, without requiring to collect and store the data on a single server. Empirical results show that the federated data-driven evolutionary algorithms perform comparably well with centralized data-driven algorithms, while being able to preserve the data privacy.
