    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    This talk will discuss about the successful application of artificial intelligence in the view of optimization based on computational intelligence. It will also analyze some facts of artificial intelligence implementation in engineering. Following the framework of modeling and algorithmic designing, several application cases of optimization based on computational intelligence are introduced. The cases are in the fields of computer vision, intelligent manufacturing, software engineering, logistics and statistics. Some critical thinking ideas about AI application will be summarized at the end of the talk.

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
    Dr. Huang Han is a professor and doctoral supervisor of the School of Software Engineering at the South China University of Technology. He is currently serving as an associate editor of IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computation (IF: 11.554) and is the Director of Teaching Steering Committee for Software Engineering of Undergraduate Colleges and Universities in Guangdong Province. Prof. Huang has made great contributions to the scholarship on the theories and application of intelligent optimization algorithms. For example, he has proposed a time complexity analysis method of real-world evolutionary algorithms, algorithms for efficient and accurate image matting, a method for automated test case generation based on path coverage, etc. Prof. Huang has hosted more than ten national and provincial projects and published more than 60 papers in IEEE TCYB, IEEE TETC, IEEE TSE, IEEE TEVC, IEEE TIP, IEEE TFS, IEEE TII, IEEE CIM, and Science China, including ESI highly cited papers. Moreover, Prof. Huang attaches great importance to bridging theory and practice. He has 31 inventions with granted Chinese patents and three inventions with granted U.S. patents, and he has been granted or has licensed nearly two-thirds of his patented technologies. Additionally, he pays attention to social services. Over the past five years, he has given more than 50 public lectures on science and technology for government offices, primary and secondary schools, CCF, YOCSEF, media, etc. He also values the domestic alternatives to foreign software and has been in charge of the development and release of a number of public software systems such as www.autosem.net and www.eatimecomplexity.net, which have provided free technical service and support for lots of researchers and engineers.
