    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    Traditional optimization algorithm design usually suffers from the following deficiencies, such as adopting the principle of local optimality without global optimization capability, overly pursuing a uniform methodology that does not match the problem, not paying attention to existing optimization experience, lacking knowledge of the optimization environment, etc. The ideas of existing AI research are inspiring to address these shortcomings. This presentation will introduce some research advances in this direction in recent years, including the design of model- and data-driven local continuous optimization algorithms, algorithms for solving MIMO detection problems in 5G communication based on deep learning techniques, and the design of evolutionary algorithms based on reinforcement learning.
