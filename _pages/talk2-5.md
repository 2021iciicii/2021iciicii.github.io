    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        Aviation Industry contains many complex engineering optimization problems. This talk mainly introduces some recent advances in optimization based on computational intelligence. Complex optimization scenarios include multiobjective optimization, noisy optimization, expensive optimization, etc. The applications of these optimization methods in Aviation have also been demonstrated in this talk.
