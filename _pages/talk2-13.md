    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    This report mainly introduces the research on swarm intelligence aggregation and emergence based on the genetic evolution of organisms and cell morphological development process, focusing on the analysis of the generation and transformation laws of swarm aggregation morphology under dynamic environments, exploring the key mechanism of interaction among individuals on swarm emergence, and discovering the behavior rules of individuals in the swarm inspired by morphological development and other methods. Specifically, it includes some research results of swarms in self-organization aggregation and form transformation, negotiation decision-making under the local information conditions, distributed decision-making under the condition of complex tasks, learning and evolution of behavior rules and their interpretability, etc., so as to enhance the intelligence, adaptability, robustness and scalability of unmanned cluster systems based on swarm intelligence.
