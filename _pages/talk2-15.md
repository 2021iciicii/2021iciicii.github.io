    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    As the world is geared towards a greener society, the route we shall take for sustainable development needs to be designed carefully. In this regard, one not only need to account for technical but also financial aspects of the options we have at hand. This presentation gives a brief overview of lessons learnt from South Africa practices on energy conservation measures that contributed largely to reducing energy consumptions from coal-fired power plants. In particular, a generic framework that decomposes the overall efficiency of an energy system into four subcategories for identifying green opportunities is presented. Two examples are given to demonstrate the application of this framework together with energy optimisation techniques. Thereafter, measurement and verification (M&V) methodologies are introduced for third parties to audit the actual energy savings achieved.  It concludes that performance analysis, energy optimisation, and M&V are indispensable for identifying energy savings opportunities, improving energy efficiency, and verifying energy savings.

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
    Prof. Lijun Zhang obtained his PhD degree from the University of Pretoria in 2016 and his MEng and BEng degrees from Wuhan University in 2012 and 2010, respectively. Prof. Zhang started his first Lecturer position at the University of Pretoria in July 2014 and was promoted to permanent Associate Professor in 2019. Thereafter, he joined Huazhong University of Science and Technology as a Professor in March 2021. Prof. Zhang has extensive experience in the optimisation and control of energy systems including railway and passenger vehicles, industrial processes, and renewable energy systems. He worked closely with the industry such as the South African electricity utility company Eskom, mining company Exxaro Resources Ltd and the large South African rail, port and pipeline company Transnet SOC Ltd. He was the incumbent of the Exxaro Energy Efficiency Chair during 2014 to 2019. He is a technical signatory for the measurement and verification of energy savings accredited by the South African National Accreditation System and a professional engineer registered with the Engineering Council of South Africa. His current research focuses on green mobility and improving the energy efficiency of energy systems through modelling, optimisation and control techniques.  He is an Associate Editor for the Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems, and a Specialist Editor for the SAIEE Africa Research Journal.
