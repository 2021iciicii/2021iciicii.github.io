    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        Rehabilitation training is a continuous while tedious process which causes slackness of patients. Engagement or active training of stroke patients helps to increase the neural activities of the cerebral cortex, and thus promotes neuroplasticity. In this talk, we discuss the challenges and possible solutions to enhance the engagement of patients using brain computer interface techniques in the process of rehabilitation training.
