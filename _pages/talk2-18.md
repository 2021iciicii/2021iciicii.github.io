    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    With development of nanotechnology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, electronic devices can be miniaturized to reduce their footprints, power consumption and signal processing time. Till now, most of these devices are powered by external power sources, including batteries and supercapacitors, that have limited lifetime. In this talk, a brief review on the mechanism and application of direct current (DC) power generation through dynamic semiconductor junction, which can generate a continuous DC current with a current density fromto. This value is about 6 orders of magnitude higher than the electrostatic generators, piezoelectric generators and triboelectric generators. Because the excellent physical properties of semiconductor materials, dynamic semiconductor junction generator can couple with other physical effect such as photovoltaic effect and thermoelectric effect, which will induce more interesting electrical output characteristics.
