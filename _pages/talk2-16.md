    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    In essence, internet of things (IoT) is composed of internet of sensors (IoS), as large-scale distributed IoT network is based on large numbers of sensors to collect data from environment. The main challenge for the distributed sensors is the energy supply, which is normally provided by chemical batteries, leading to high maintenance cost and potential pollutions. Micro&nano generators harvest energy from solar radiation and mechanical movement, which offers great potential to replace chemical batteries, overcoming those challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly researched nowadays. For AI technology, sensors are also required to build up machine learning process. This presentation talks some recent R&D on the synergies between nanogenerator based sensors and AI.

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
    Prof. Lijie Li (SMIEEE, FIET, FHEA) received the Ph.D. degree in MEMS from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 2004. His research interests are in developing MEMS transducers, energy harvesting devices, semiconductor materials and devices, piezotronics, optical and radio frequency (RF) MEMS devices and systems. Moreover, he is interested in first principles study of nanodevices and nanomaterials, as well as machine learning techniques with applications in transducers.
